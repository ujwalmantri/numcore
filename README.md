# 🧮 numcore

A comprehensive mathematics library built from scratch by a first-year student. Currently in active development with a goal of **250+ functions**.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/numcore.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/numcore/)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## 🚀 Installation
```bash
pip install numcore
```

## 📖 Usage
```python
from numcore import n_input
from numcore import counter

# Get 5 integers from user
numbers = n_input(5)
print(numbers)

# Count occurrences in a list
result = counter(['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'a'])
print(result)  # Output: {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
```

## ✨ Features
